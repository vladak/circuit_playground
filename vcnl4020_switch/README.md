# VCNL4020 based switch

The intention is to simulate a switch. By placing hand over the VCNL4020 sensor,
for a certain duration, the switch will flip. In this simple experiment,
the Neopixel on the microcontroller will turn on/off.

This will be eventually used to construct sort of a lamp out of a strip of Neopixels.
